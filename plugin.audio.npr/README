= NPR on XBMC =

This add-on for XBMC allows access to all available NPR streams.  It
achieves this by querying the API found at
'http://api.npr.org/stations.php' for the streaming stations that each
NPR station publishes.  To avoid saturating the site I have
pre-compiled a list of all NPR stations that have at least one live
stream (npr_stations.csv).  The script 'stations.py' can be used to
generate a new csv file if necessary.

= Credit & Thanks =

* Thanks to Fisslefink for the original code.  It helped a lot when
  learning how to create this addon.
