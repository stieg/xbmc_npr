= NPR on XBMC =

This add-on for XBMC allows access to all available NPR streams.  It
achieves this by querying the API found at
'http://api.npr.org/stations.php' for the streaming stations that each
NPR station publishes.  To avoid saturating the site I have
pre-compiled a list of all NPR stations that have a least one stream
(npr_stations.csv).  The script 'stations.py' can be used to generate
a new csv file if necessary.

= Notes =

* This plugin has been tested and verified to work on the pre-releases
  of Eden (12/23).
* This release uses my API key to NPR.  This will change in the
  future
