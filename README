= NPR on XBMC =

This add-on for XBMC allows access to all available NPR streams and
most podcasts.  It achieves this by querying the API found at
'http://api.npr.org/stations.php' for the streaming stations that each
NPR station publishes.  For purposes of speed I have
pre-compiled a list of all NPR stations that have at least one live
stream (npr_stations.csv).  The script 'stations.py' can be used to
generate a new csv file if necessary.

= Installation =

1. Install Git on your local machine.  See http://git-scm.com/ for
   git installers and tutorials on how to use Git.

2. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following
   command:

   git clone git://github.com/stieg/xbmc_npr.git plugin.audio.npr

3. Move the "plugin.audio.npr" directory to you local XBMC addons
   directory.  You can find these directories at the following
   locations:
